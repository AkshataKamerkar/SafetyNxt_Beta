# 🛡️ SafetyNXT: Enhancing Road Safety Through Real-Time Monitoring 


* Welcome to SafetyNXT, a revolutionary web application that's your co-pilot on every journey. We're using the power of real-time monitoring and deep learning to make roads safer. From detecting accidents and alerting nearby hospitals, to identifying potholes and monitoring traffic, SafetyNXT is your one-stop solution for a safer and more efficient driving experience. Join us as we drive towards a safer future!

## 🌐 Overview

* SafetyNXT is a web application 🌐 designed to enhance road safety 🛣️ and improve emergency response 🚑 through real-time monitoring 📡 and detection of various anomalies, including accidents 🚗, potholes ⚠️, and traffic 🚦.

* The project addresses two major challenges: unnoticed road accidents lacking quick medical response and driver unawareness of road conditions. By utilizing a network of road CCTV cameras 🎥 and deep learning models 🧠, SafetyNXT continuously scans for potential accidents along highways and major roads. Once an accident is detected, the system promptly alerts the nearest hospitals 🏥 to ensure timely assistance.
